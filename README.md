# Student-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyses student performance data using Python. The goal is to explore how study hours and gender relate to academic marks by identifying patterns,trends and relationships.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Key Questions
- Is there a relationship between study hours and marks?
- Do performance levels differ by gender?

## Key Insights
- A weak to modarate positive relationship exists between study hours and marks.
- Significant variability suggests that factors beyond study time influence performance.
- Female students showed a slightly higher average performance in this dataset.

## Visualisations
- Scatter plot showing the relationship between study hours and marks

## Conclusion
While increased study hours may contribute to improved performance, the wide dispersion suggests that student peformance is also significantly influenced by other factors, such as study quality, prior knowledge, or learning strategies.
